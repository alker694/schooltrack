## 🚀 Installation (First Time Only)

### Step 1 — Install Node.js

3. The server starts and your **browser opens automatically**
4. Default PIN is: **1234** (change it immediately in Settings)

### Step 4 — Auto-Start with Windows (Recommended)

1. Double-click `SETUP_AUTOSTART.bat` as Administrator
2. SchoolTrack will now start automatically every time the PC turns on

### Step 5 — Build EXE Installer (Optional)

If you want a single EXE file for easy installation on multiple PCs:

1. Install **NSIS** from [https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
2. Right-click `installer.nsi` → **Compile NSIS Script**
3. `SchoolTrack_Installer.exe` will be created — distribute this to other PCs

## 📱 Connecting Admin Phones

1. Make sure the phone is connected to the **same WiFi** as the dean's PC
2. Open the browser on the phone (Chrome recommended)
3. Enter the server address shown in the terminal, e.g.:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.15:3000
   ```
4. Bookmark this address for easy access
5. Enter the PIN when prompted

> **Tip:** To find the IP address, look at the terminal window when SchoolTrack starts — it shows "Network: http://X.X.X.X:3000"

## 🔄 Syncing Between Admin Phones

SchoolTrack is a **server-client** system — all phones talk to the same server, so data is always live and synchronized automatically.

> You do **not** need to manually sync in normal operation. All phones see the same data in real time.

**Use Import/Export when:**
- Setting up a second installation (e.g., a backup laptop)
- Transferring data to a new PC
- Sharing data via USB when WiFi is unavailable

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Browser doesn't open automatically | Open manually: `http://localhost:3000` |
| Phone can't connect | Ensure phone is on same WiFi; check firewall |
| Forgot PIN | Open `data/settings.json` and change `"pin"` value |
| "node_modules not found" | Run `npm install` in the AttendanceSystem folder |
| Server won't start | Check if port 3000 is used by another app |
| Data lost after update | Data is in `data/` folder — never delete this folder |

### Allow Through Windows Firewall

If phones can't connect, run this in Command Prompt as Administrator:
```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SchoolTrack" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The system is **LAN-only** — completely inaccessible from the internet
- PIN protects admin access on all devices
- All data stored locally — no cloud, no external servers
- Teacher check-in is on the dean PC — phone admins cannot modify it
- Backups created automatically before every data import

---

## 📞 Support

This system is self-contained. For customization or issues:
- Check the terminal window for error messages
- Review `data/*.json` files if data issues occur
- Use the Sync > Export feature regularly for backups
